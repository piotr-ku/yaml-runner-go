# YAML Runner Go

YAML Runner Go is an application that executes commands based on the rules defined in a YAML file. It provides the flexibility to run commands either once or as a daemon at specific intervals.

## Usage

`yaml-runner-go [command]`

## Available Commands

* completion: Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
* daemon: Run actions periodically in the background
* help: Help about any command
* oneshot: Runs actions once and exits

## Flags

* --config string: Specifies the configuration file in YAML format (default: "./config.yaml")
* --debug: Enables debug logging
* --help, -h: Provides help for yaml-runner-go
* --interval string: Sets the interval for the daemon
* --json: Enables JSON formatting for the output
* --log string: Enables logging to a file
--quiet: Enables quiet mode

To get more information about a specific command, use the following syntax:

`yaml-runner-go [command] --help`

## Use Cases

YAML Runner Go can be useful in various scenarios where you need to automate command execution based on a YAML file configuration. Here are some possible use cases:

1. **Scheduled Tasks**: By running YAML Runner Go as a daemon, you can schedule and automate recurring tasks. For example, you can define commands to be executed at specific intervals, such as fetching data from APIs, running backups, or performing system maintenance.

2. **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: YAML Runner Go can be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines to execute commands defined in the YAML configuration. This allows you to automate build processes, run tests, deploy applications, or trigger other actions based on specific events or conditions.

3. **System Administration**: You can use YAML Runner Go to streamline and automate various system administration tasks. For instance, you can define commands to monitor system resources, check for software updates, manage user accounts, or perform routine maintenance tasks on multiple servers.

4. **Data Processing**: If you have data processing pipelines that involve executing specific commands or scripts, YAML Runner Go can help simplify the execution and management of these pipelines. You can define commands to process data files, perform transformations, extract information, or generate reports based on your YAML configuration.

5. **Monitoring and Alerting**: YAML Runner Go can be utilized to periodically execute commands that monitor system metrics, log files, or external services. By defining actions in the YAML file to check for specific conditions or trigger alerts, you can proactively monitor your infrastructure and receive notifications when anomalies or critical events occur.

These are just a few examples of how YAML Runner Go can be applied in different scenarios. The flexibility of defining commands in a YAML file and the ability to run them either as one-shot tasks or as a recurring daemon make it a versatile tool for automating command execution in various domains.
